# 1.1 Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the top three most commonly diagnosed cancers.
According to WHO, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
For instance, approximately 2.21 million new cases of lung cancer were reported in
2020, making up 11.4% of all cancer diagnoses globally. Lung cancer occurs when
genetic mutation of normal cells in the lungs happened resulting in uncontrollable
growth and division of the cells. These mutations disrupt the normal mechanisms that
regulate cell growth, division, and death, leading to the formation of a tumor. Lung
cancer can be divided into two types, which is differentiated through the appearance
under microscope, NSCLC and SCLC. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer,
which accounts for about 80-85% of all lung cancers while SCLC accounts for about 10-
15%, but spread more rapidly and is strongly associated with smoking habit.
Nowadays, there are many people at risk of lung cancer which smoking is proven
to be the leading factor that triggers lung cancer. Even people without smoking habit are
at risk due to the fact that they might be exposed to environment that have tobacco
smoke which makes them a passive smoker. Overall, the five-year survival rate for
NSCLC average at around 24% but can be higher at around 61% to 92% provided that
the disease was diagnosed at early stages. The more aggressive SCLC have a very low
five-year survival rate at approximately 7% according to the American Cancer Society.
This mean that people who are diagnosed with SCLC are almost confirm to die within 5
years, depending on how fast the disease was diagnosed.

Although there is no cure, we can minimize our chance of developing lung
cancer by avoiding bad habit such as smoking, exposure to carcinogenic substances, and
unnecessary exposure to radiation such as Radon. Lung cancer can be diagnosed with
Lung CT (Computer Tomography) scan, chest X-rays, MRI scans, or Biopsy (surgery).
It is said that Lung CT scans are widely used in detecting lung cancer due to their ability
to provide detailed images of the lungs.
