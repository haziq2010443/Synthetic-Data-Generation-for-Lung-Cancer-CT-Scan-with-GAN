# Project Overview

## Background

Lung cancer is one of the top three most commonly diagnosed cancers.
According to WHO, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
For instance, approximately 2.21 million new cases of lung cancer were reported in
2020, making up 11.4% of all cancer diagnoses globally. Lung cancer occurs when
genetic mutation of normal cells in the lungs happens resulting in uncontrollable
growth and division of the cells. These mutations disrupt the normal mechanisms that
regulate cell growth, division, and death, leading to the formation of a tumor. Lung
cancer can be divided into two types, which are differentiated through their appearance
under the microscope, NSCLC and SCLC. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer,
which accounts for about 80-85% of all lung cancers while SCLC accounts for about 10-
15%, but spread more rapidly and is strongly associated with smoking habit.
Nowadays, there are many people at risk of lung cancer and smoking is proven
to be the leading factor that triggers lung cancer. Even people without smoking habit are
at risk because they might be exposed to an environment that has tobacco
smoke which makes them passive smokers. Overall, the five-year survival rate for
NSCLC average at around 24% but can be higher at around 61% to 92% provided that
the disease was diagnosed at early stages. The more aggressive SCLCs have a very low
five-year survival rate at approximately 7% according to the American Cancer Society.
This means that people who are diagnosed with SCLC are almost confirmed to die within 5
years, depending on how fast the disease was diagnosed.

Although there is no cure, we can minimize our chance of developing lung
cancer by avoiding bad habits such as smoking, exposure to carcinogenic substances, and
unnecessary exposure to radiation such as Radon. Lung cancer can be diagnosed with
Lung CT (Computer Tomography) scan, chest X-rays, MRI scans, or Biopsy (surgery).
It is said that Lung CT scans are widely used in detecting lung cancer due to their ability
to provide detailed images of the lungs.

## Problem Statement : <br>

To improve the health of society, the time taken to diagnose an illness should be as
short and precise as possible. Medical experts can take advantage by utilizing a predictive
modeling system that can diagnose lung cancer at a high performance and accuracy. The
main problem is that there is no deep learning model that can analyze medical images
with high confidence since medical images are considered privacy and sharing of them
will violate the Privacy Act. As a result, acquiring real CT scans costs very heavily for
companies that provide these deep learning models. Thus, medical experts cannot fully
predictive modeling systems to assist them with diagnosis. Therefore, this project will
tackle the privacy and data scarcity issue thus making the lung cancer prediction model
possible.

## Objectives :

*To train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN) that can generate synthetic lung CT scans that are statistically similar to real-world data and diverse.
*To design a tool that can generate synthetic lung CT scans for lung cancer disease using DCGANs.
*To develop a tool that can reproduce Lung CT scan images that mimic the statistical pattern and properties of lung cancer data.

## Project Significance : <br>

The significance of this project lies in its potential to address a critical challenge
in creating a predictive model for lung cancer diagnosis: data scarcity. Predictive model
systems can assist medical experts in the early detection of lung cancer, but acquiring data to
generate the system can be expensive, time-consuming, and ethically complex. This
limited data availability obstructed the development and training of accurate AI models
for lung detection.

This project proposes a solution to use DCGANs to generate realistic and diverse
synthetic lung cancer CT scans. This synthetic data can be used to:

*Augment existing datasets
*Reduce costs and improve access to diagnosis
*Develop and test new AI algorithms

## Conclusion : <br>

In conclusion, this project will use a Generative machine learning model to
generate synthetic Lung CT scan images. We will be comparing and choosing the best
model that satisfies the objectives in generating the synthetic Lung CT scan images after
all of the models have been completed.
