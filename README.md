# Synthetic Data Generation for Lung Cancer CT Scan using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, and early detection of the
disease is needed to help control the nature of the cancer cells. However, the usage of
Predictive Modeling Systems that utilize Artificial Intelligence to help medical experts
in diagnosis are still in the experimental phase due to a lack of real data that helps create 
a reliable prediction system. This project proposes a tool for synthetic data generation of
lung cancer CT scans utilizing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
(DCGANs) framework. The proposed tool aims to address the data scarcity issue by
generating realistic and diverse synthetic CT scans. The images generated will facilitate
improved training of AI models for accurate lung cancer diagnosis. The potential impact
of this project lies in its ability to augment existing datasets, mitigate data biases, and
boost the performance of computer-aided diagnosis systems in detecting diseases like
lung cancer in their early phase.
