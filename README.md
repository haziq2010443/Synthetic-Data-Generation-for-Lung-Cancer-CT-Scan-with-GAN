# Synthetic Data Generation for Lung Cancer CT Scan using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, and early detection of the
disease are needed to helps control the nature of the cancer cells. However, usage of
Predictive Modeling Systems that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to help medical experts
in diagnosis are still in experimental phase due to lack of real data that helps create a
reliable predicting systems. This project proposes a tool for synthetic data generation of
lung cancer CT scans utilizing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
(DCGANs) framework. The proposed tool aims to address the data scarcity issue by
generating realistic and diverse synthetic CT scans. The images generated will facilitate
improved training of AI models for accurate lung cancer diagnosis. The potential impact
of this project lies in its ability to augment existing datasets, mitigate data biases, and
boost the performance of computer-aided diagnosis systems in detecting diseases like
lung cancer in their early phase.
